                <h1>About him:</h1>
                <p>Joshua Jagan Hamilton or, as the internet knows him, Lil Darkie (“Lil Dvrkie”, “The small dark one” or “Brahman”) is an experimental rapper from Long Beach, California.</p>
                <p>He was born in Los Angeles on October the 6th of 1998, under an interracial family, with mixed ethnicities in his family. Belonging to so many different races and cultures made him not believe in races and that kind of stuff.</p>
                <p>As he showed no interest in embracing any race he didn’t fit anywhere and was bullied for that. As he says in some of his songs, his bullies called him a “little darkie”.</p>
                <p>He started rapping at the age of 16 as a way of expressing himself and releasing his angerness to feel free to show love and positivity to the world in his message to human race. He started to rap something he calls <b id="explanation">yell rapping</b> under the alias <a href="https://soundcloud.com/brahmvn" rel="external" target="_blank">Brahman</a>, in those first tracks he uploaded to soundcloud he focused a lot in lyrics rather than focusing in the musical aspect of his productions</p>
                <p>On april the 4th of 2018 he released his first single as “Lil darkie”, he picked that alias as a reference to the nickname he was called by his bullies in middle school and highschool.</p>
                <p>Since then he has gained a lot of fans through the entire internet, he also formed the group <b id="spidergang">Spider Gang</b> with rappers and artists of the same style as him.</p>
                <p>His cartoon character that appears in his music videos is a representation of himself based on what he saw looking himself in a mirror while he was on LSD. As he colours himself black he was accused of being racist, but the truth is that he is coloured like that in reference to ancient indian gods wich were described to be dark as dark as the night sky. </p>

                        <p>Yell rapping is usually known as scream rapping, it is a rap variant practiced by a wide variety of artists such as Lil Uzi, 6ix9ine, XXX Tentation… it consists in expressing the artist feelings (usually angriness) by screaming or acting furious.</p>
                        <p>Lil darkie takes this to his own flow by making complex lyrics full of references to his life and modern culture. He also distinguishes himself by using his own cartoonish and peculiar voice and accompanying his songs with rather violent cartoon music videos drawn by himself in his peculiar art style which fits really well with the mood of his songs.</p>
